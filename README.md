# Triangle Speech and Orofacial Myology website

This is the new version of triangle speech OM. This site is built on Gridsome SSG and uses netlify CMS as it's primary data source to allow for easy editing of site content.

## To develop (Hi future me)
### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool if you don't have

`npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Run the project

`npm run develop` or `gridsome develop` will start the project on `localhost:8080` with hot reloading.
