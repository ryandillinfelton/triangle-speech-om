Thumb, digit, or pacifier sucking is common in infancy and early childhood but is a habit that should be eliminated before a child gets his or her adult teeth. These sucking patterns can result in changes to the palate and the dentition, often leading to an open bite or other malocclusions.

The clinician will meet with the child and determine his or her readiness to eliminate the habit and work with him or her over a ten day period. This program helps the child to take the lead role in this process, empowering him or her and giving him or her a sense of accomplishment.
