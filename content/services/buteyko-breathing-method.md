Ms. Felton is trained in the Buteyko Breathing Method, which was developed as a drug free way to reverse dysfunctional breathing, such as in asthma, COPD, or sleep apnea. Dysfunctional breathing patterns can lead to several chronic health problems and also impact how an individual's teeth and facial structures develop. The Buteyko Breathing Technique has been tested and has been found to be effective and safe.

Dysfunctional breathing patterns that can be treated with Buteyko include the following:

* asthma
* adenoid and tonsil inflammation
* snoring
* nasal polyps
* upper airway obstruction
* COPD

This technique may be used in conjunction with Orofacial Myology Therapy for the best results with orthodontics.
