Children with language disorders often struggle academically. This may be because the child's processing speed is slow, he does not understand or use language structures, or he has a limited vocabulary.

When a child's processing is slow, it is often difficult for him to keep up with the lecture and he consequently misses information. The child may have auditory working memory limitations that make it challenging to take notes or he may simply not understand complex language well. An evaluation can help to identify the specific areas of need for the child with recommendations for therapy to help improve these skills and classroom accommodations to enhance his learning experience. Ms. Felton worked on Auditory Processing Teams at Duke and NCEENT and evaluated and treated many children with language related learning challenges.
