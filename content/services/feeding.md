Feeding disorders can occur for many different reasons but usually begin due
to some disruption in the typical feeding development process. Some problems
that can interfere with appropriate feeding advancement include reflux,
prematurity, sensory problems, anatomic differences, or oral motor challenges.
Behavioral problems often develop out of these.

Ms. Felton uses an approach to feeding disorders that adresses the underlying problems that are impacting the child’s feeding while working with the family on mealtime practices that may be impeding the child’s progress with a goal of making mealtimes a pleasurable experience for the whole family.
