A baby with a short lingual frenulum, otherwise known as tongue tie, may have difficulty with nursing, resulting in prolonged feeding, falling asleep at the breast, difficulty gaining weight and/or significant breast pain for the mother. It may also make it difficult for an infant to move food around in the mouth, causing gagging or vomiting.

Ms. Felton is trained in the Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (ATLFF), which was developed by Alison Hazelbaker and is the only evidence-based tongue tie screening tool for infants 37 weeks gestation to 6-months of age. Older children may also have tongue or lip ties that have not been addressed and may be causing problems with speech and/or feeding.
