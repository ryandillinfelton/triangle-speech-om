Ms. Felton has been trained in PROMPT (Prompts for Restructuring Oral Muscular Phonetic Targets), a technique that incorporates neuromotor principles, kinesthetic and proprioceptive information, as well as auditory and visual information to provide feedback to the speech system, in order for an individual to produce clear, functional speech.

The PROMPT clinician provides input to all areas of oral motor system by using touch, pressure, specific placements, as well as creating auditory and visual awareness. This helps an individual achieve controlled, functional speech.
