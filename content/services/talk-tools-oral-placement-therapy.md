Ms. Felton has completed through Level 3 training in Talk Tools Oral Placement
Therapy, an oral motor approach that addresses feeding and speech disorders.
The approach utilizes the auditory and visual stimuli while adding the tactile
and proprioceptive sensory systems.


It allows the patient to not only hear and see the cues for speech, but to feel them as well. In addition, this technique is used to build strength in the orofacial muscles to improve speech clarity and to improve feeding. An OPT evaluation examines your child's current functional level and sets up a treatment plan that includes daily homework for the patient with the help of his family and a plan for therapy. If the child is not being followed in this clinic, updated assessments may be completed monthly or quarterly.
